                    JavaZone – the biggest European community-driven conference for modern developers will be 17 years old in 2018! Don’t miss out on two days of inspiring tech talks, a day of hands-on sessions, mingling, and a great party!
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaZone is organized by javaBin, the Norwegian Java User Group. Our goal is to organize a community-driven conference for Java developers where they can learn new things, share knowledge, and socialize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have been organizing JavaZone since 2001 and have been excited to watch the event grow bigger and better every year. In 2017 we hosted over 3100 participants and 200 speakers across 7 parallel tracks over the course of two days. In addition, we also offered a selection of 9 workshops held on the day before the conference started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would not be what we are today without YOU! Thank you for your support and contributions over the years. Don’t procrastinate! Join your fellow Java developers at JavaZone on September 12th-13th, 2018!

                    Lightning talks are either 10 or 20 minutes long and often gives a quick introduction to a concept. This is a great way to get a sneak peek at something new.

This will be a special experience at a bar with it's own distillery. Here you can mingle and enjoy the good atmosphere, whilst watching the white coated bartenders work their magic!

                <p>
                    JavaZone is a 100% community-organized conference created by javaBin. The program is chosen by our independent program committee, and they operate under the principle that no-one is paid to hold a presentation, and likewise, that no-one can pay us to get their presentation accepted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We as organizers strive to create the best possible learning experience for all our speakers and participants, and we expect you to do the same. Everyone is welcome at JavaZone, but we do require that you treat your fellow conference participants with respect. We reserve the right to take any action necessary to make sure this principle is upheld. For more details, see our Code of Conduct that applies to all events organised by javaBin.
